# Skin-Cancer-Detection

Skin cancer, the most common human malignancy is primarily diagnosed visually, beginning with an initial clinical screening and followed potentially by dermoscopic analysis, a biopsy and histopathological examination. Automated classification of skin lesions using images is a challenging task owing to the fine-grained variability in the appearance of skin lesions. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs)show potential for general and highly variable tasks across many fine-grained object categories. Here I have demonstrated classification of skin lesions using a single CNN, trained end-to-end from images directly, using only pixels and disease labels as inputs.
